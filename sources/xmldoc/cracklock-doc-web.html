    For legacy version of Windows (95, 98 or ME), please download version 3.8.3 from my <a class="ulink" href="http://william.famille-blum.org/" target="_top">website</a>.

    </p><p>You probably know the most polymorphic and sadistic virus of this ending century, the
      so-called "30th day virus". It attacks the best sharewares as well as the worst
      ones, introducing as soon as you install them a bug that prevents them from running beyond a
      random delay, often 30 days. Cracklock has the leadership in the fighting challenge against
      this virus that even McAfee, Norton, Sophos, Thunderbyte and F-Proot seem unable to deal with.</p><p>Cracklock is also a tool that developpers may use to check Y2K-like compatibility for
      their products without having to change the system time, thus avoiding side-effects.</p><div class="section" lang="en" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h4 class="title"><a id="id685053"></a>What's new ?</h4></div></div></div><p>
      It is now possible to run Cracklock from a usb flashdisk.
      In this mode, the settings are saved on disk in a Cracklock.settings file.
      By default this file is stored along with cracklock binaries.
      An option let you tell cracklock to save the settings in the current user's Appdata folder or in the Windows registry.
    </p><p>
      Another option can be set to store the per-application
      settings in each application's directory. If you run an executable file called "App.exe" that is (statically or run-time) injected by Cracklock
       and if there exists an associated configuration file called "App.exe.cracklock"
      next to it in the application directory then 
      Cracklock will load the settings from that file instead of the general cracklock setting storage (the registry or the main setting file).

When a program from this list needs
        time or date, Cracklock operates, bluffing the calling program and returning the
        pre-determined date or time you have set. So, the program "thinks" to be at the
        date/time it accepts for running.</p><div class="variablelist"><dl><dt><span class="term">For the end user</span></dt><dd><p>Cracklock protects you from the 30th day bug, a defect that is becoming very
              frequent in nowadays software. A program affected by this bug will fail to run when a
              certain period of time has passed after its installation.</p></dd><dt><span class="term">For the developer: a safe method for Y2K testing</span></dt><dd><p>With the help of Cracklock, developers can readily test or check the "Year
              2000 compatibility" (Y2K) of their software.</p><p>Suppose that you want to check the program you are developing for Y2K
              compatibility. To perform the test you decide to change the global system date/time to
              31th december 1999 and then launch your program in order to debug it. The drawback of
              this method is that it affects all the programs currently running on the machine. One
              consequence is that the date stamp of the files created or modified by any software
              running on Windows will be set to 31th december 1999.</p><p>Some other software may even stop working, as if they were "lost in
              time". That would be the case for all these poorly developed softwares that are
              affected by the notorious "30th day bug". If you run such software while you
              are testing your program against Y2K compliance, then you will run into trouble: the
              bugged sofware will be confused about the date and will stop working.</p><p>Cracklock overcomes all these problems by allowing you to specify the date on an
              application basis.</p></dd></dl></div></div><div class="section" lang="en" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h4 class="title"><a id="configuration"></a>Setting up an application for Cracklock</h4></div></div></div><p>Start the manager (shortcut <span class="bold"><strong>Cracklock Manager</strong></span> in

            </p><div class="variablelist"><dl><dt><span class="term">System-wide</span></dt><dd><p>This will affect the system date and time. With this option, each time you
                    run the controlled program, the system computer time and date will be changed to
                    the date/time that you have specified. When the program ends, date and time will
                    be restored to the actual date and time, taking account of elapsed time during
                    usage of the program. &lt;br&gt; The drawback of this method is that all
                    programs running simultaneously are affected together, Cracklock in its native
                    method being precisely designed to affect specific date and time to each program
                    running at one given moment and to avoid this inconvenience. &lt;br&gt; This
                    option reproduces what you can do yourself manually without Cracklock, with the
                    "date" or "time" commands under MS/DOS or with the
                    configuration panel under Windows. In my mind, it has no real benefit.</p></dd><dt><span class="term">Freeze date and time</span></dt><dd><p>This "freeze" option allows to set a date/time which never
                    changes, as if the time was frozen. Useful for programs that work only during a
                    few hours or minutes. &lt;br&gt; For example, if you set 10:00:00 09/22/1981 for
                    this program, during all the run it will "think" the time is 10:00:00
                    09/22/1981.Ten minutes later, the time will still be 10:00:00 09/22/1981 for the
                    application. If the option is not selected, however, at the start the program
                    will have a time of 10:00:00 09/22/1981, and ten minutes later it will be
                    10:10:00 09/22/1981.</p></dd><dt><span class="term">Injection mode</span></dt><dd><p> In the "injection mode" tab of the configuration window, you can
                    select between two different modes: static or run-time </p><p>With static-injection, Cracklock will alter the executable file of your
                    application in order to make it load Cracklock. You can additionally tell
                    Cracklock which file it should modify by selecting an executable file among the
                    list of dependencies of your application.The license that you signed when you
                    install a software often prevents you from modifying its executable files - even
                    for the purpose of correcting a bug, as in the present case - so if you have
                    signed such a license then you must not use static injection.</p><p>The other mode is "run-time injection":</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="injectionmode_window.png" /></div><p>Using the run-time injection, Cracklock does not modify any executable file
                    from your application, everything happens at run-time. Note that in this case
                    you need to make sure that the system-wide injection is activated otherwise you
                    will have to start the program from a special shortcut or from wihtin the
                    manager.</p></dd></dl></div><p>

        for each application. It will be appended to the command line when the application is runned from within the manager.
      </p></li><li><p>New: per-application setting called "stand-alone mode". In the normal mode the behaviour is the same as before. In full stand-alone mode, the settings and the injected DLL are copied to the program folder. In a third "in-between" mode, only the settings are stored in the application folder.
      When adding a new application, if the file App.exe.cracklock is present in the directory then default settings are loaded from this file.
      It is deleted when when the application is removed from cracklock.
      </p></li><li><p>New: option to let the user change the command parameters that are used to start the application from the Manager.
      </p></li><li><p>New: option in the general settings: Shared/Stand-alone installation. In shared mode, Cracklock's directory is added to the PATH environment variable. In stand-alone mode, the injected DLL is copied to each application's folder.

      </p></li><li><p>Bug fixed: The loader now accepts relative paths.
      </p></li><li><p> Setup: There is now a new 'Flashdisk installation' mode.  In this mode, nothing is written in the Windows Registry and shortcuts are not created.
      </p></li><li><p>Setup: a new option let you choose where you want to store the setting file (registry, application data folder or cracklock's folder).
      </p></li><li><p>
        Setup: import the settings from the registry to the INI file if the user choose to store settings in an INI file.
