I HOW TO TRANSLATE AN APPLICATION SUCH AS CRACKLOCK
===================================================

	- Launch PTE.EXE	   
	- Open the LANGUAGE.PRJ file
	- translate every line of text. 
	- save your work,
	- send the LANGUAGE.TOK file to wblum@multimania.com.

Your work will be released on my website !


II NOTE
=======

	1. The string "English" must be replaced by the name of the translated language
	(ex: Espãnol, Français, English US, English UK, Russian, Chinese, etc...)


	2. You don't have to translate strings containing numbers like following one:
		
		 "91   40  195   91 : TDB"


	3. The symbol '&' is used to underline the next letter in menus and buttons.

	For example, in this line:

		"&Program"

	the letter 'P' of the 'Program' menu will be underlined so you will be able
	to access the menu by pressing ALT+P.

	When you translate these type of strings, you can place the & symbol where you want.
	

 HAVE A GOOD TRANSLATION !
