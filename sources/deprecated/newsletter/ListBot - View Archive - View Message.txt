Hello,

Cracklock 3.8.3 is available, you can download it at
http://www.cracklock.net/

This new version includes arabic and croatian dialog boxes and messages.
There are now 5 languages packaged with Cracklock.

A lot of people told me tbat some softwares can't be cracked with
Cracklock. Most of the time, you just have to select the application EXE
file in the dependency tab of the configuration dialog box to force the
crack. But remember that this will modify the selected file and a vicious
software can easily detect this.

If you want to know how to configure cracklock for a specific software,
post a message on the cracklock forum :
