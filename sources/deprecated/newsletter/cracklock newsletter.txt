Cracklock.net updates

Hello !


The Cracklock site has moved. Now, you can access it at http://www.cracklock.net

There, you can download Cracklock version 3.8.2. 

Online chat and forum have been added to the site in order to
let users talk about Cracklock.

Pardon me if I don't reply to your e-mail messages but I'm currently working
a lot at university because I'm preparing High School entrance examination so
I've very few time to spend at searching Cracklock bugs (at least if there are
really bugs in it !).

I will probably write a FAQ in order to answer frequent questions about Cracklock,
but if someone has any advice to tell to other users, he should send it to me and
I will post it on the site.


Due to my current work, the next release of Cracklock will probably be released on
next summer holidays (July 2001).
