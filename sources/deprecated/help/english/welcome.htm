	<h2>Welcome to Cracklock Documentation</h2>
    <p>
      You probably
      know the most polymorphic and sadistic virus of this ending century, the
      so-called "<b>30th day virus</b>". It attacks the best sharewares as well
      as the worst ones, introducing as soon as you install them a bug that
      prevents them from running beyond a random delay, often 30 days.
      Cracklock has the leadership in the fighting challenge against this virus
      that even McAfee, Norton, Sophos, Thunderbyte and F-Proot seem unable to deal
      with.
    </p>
    <p>
      Cracklock is also a tool that developpers may use to check Y2K-like
      compatibility for their products without having to change the system
      time, thus avoiding side-effects.
