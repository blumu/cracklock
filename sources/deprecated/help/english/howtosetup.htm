      <h1>How to set up a program for Cracklock</h1>
    <p>
      Before anything, you must start the manager from the icon called <b>Cracklock
      Manager</b> in the <b>Cracklock</b> group of the Windows Start
      menu.
    </p>
    <p align="center">

      <b>The manager</b>
    </p>
    <h2>How to add a new program ?</h2>
    <p> The first
      thing to do if you want Cracklock to supervise a program is to add this
      program to the controlled programs list. For that, you must :
    <ul>
	<li> click twice on the <b>Add program</b> icon
    </li>
    <li>
      select the file corresponding to your program (generally it is a file with an .EXE
      extension)
    </li>
    <li> set up the parameters for this program
    </li>
    </ul>
      <i>Note :
      Currently Cracklock cannot control 16 bits programs (those designed only
      for Windows 3.1). It only runs with programs designed for 32 bits
      operating systems, i.e. Windows 95, Windows 98 or Windows NT.</i>
    </p>

	<h2>Configurating a program for use with Cracklock</h2>
	<a name="config" id= "config"></a>
    
	<p>The only non-optional parameters are the date and time settings.</p>
    <p>Select the program to parameter from the manager list. Click on the "<b>Program</b>"
      menu then on "<b>Settings...</b>"
    </p>
    <p align="center">
      <img src= "menu_prog.gif" width="111" height="110"><br>
      <b>Program menu</b>
    </p>

    <p> A window appears which suggests several options to set up :
    </p>
    <p align="center">
      <img src= "fen_options.png" width="345" height="385"><br>
      <b>Settings window</b>
    </p>
	
    <p>
      You must use
      calendar and clock to set date and time you want select.
    </p>
    <p>
      Use the
      "<b>Current date/time</b>" button to load respectively calendar and clock
      with current system date and time.
    </p>
    <p>
      Use the
      "<b>File creation date/time</b>" button to load respectively calendar and
      clock with date and time where the program was installed.
    </p>
    <p>
	You can choose if Cracklock must affect:
    <ul>
      <li> "time": only the time will be affected. The date will be the actual system
      computer date at the running time.</li>
	  <li> "date and time": Cracklock will affect date and time.
	  </li>
	  <li>"date": only the date will be affected. The time will be the actual system
      computer time at the running time.
      </li>
    </ul>
    </p>
       
    <h2>Other options</h2>
	<p>
      Most programs don't need further parameters. However, you may need to tweak some parameters in
      some cases:
    </p>
    <h3>"Affects system date and time"</h3>
    <p>
      When
      selected, this option make Cracklock less clever : each time you run the
      controlled program, the <b>system computer time and date</b> will be
      loaded with values you have specified. When the program ends, date and
      time will be restored to the actual date and time, taking account of
      elapsed time during usage of the program.
    <br>
      The drawback
      of this method is that all programs running simultaneously are affected
      together, Cracklock in its native method being precisely designed to
      affect specific date and time to each program running at one given moment
      and to avoid this inconvenience.
    <br>
      This option
      reproduces what you can do yourself manually without Cracklock, with the
      "date" or "time" commands under MS/DOS or with the configuration panel
      under Windows. In my mind, it has no real benefit.
    </p>
	
    <h3>Date and time remain constant"</h3>
    <p>
      This "freeze"
      option allows to set a date/time which never changes, as if the time was
      frozen. Useful for programs that work only during a few hours or
      minutes.
    <br>
      For example,
      if you set 10:00:00 09/22/1981 for this program, during all the run it
      will "think" the time is 10:00:00 09/22/1981. Ten minutes later, the time
      will be always 10:00:00 09/22/1981 for it.
    <br>
      At the
      opposite, if the option is not selected, at the beginning the program
      will "think" time is 10:00:00 09/22/1981, and ten minutes later it will
      "think" time is 10:10:00 09/22/1981.<br>
    </p>
    
	<h3>Advanced options</h3>
    <p> In the "Dependencies" tab of the configuration window, you have the ability to
      choose what file to be affected by Cracklock.
    </p>
    <p align="center">
      <b><img src= "fen_depend.png" width="345" height="385"><br> Dependencies window</b>
    </p>


    <p>
      <b>Often,the license that you signed when you install a software
      prevents you from modifying its executable files (even for the purpose of correcting a bug,
      as in our case). If you have signed the license then you must keep your word.</b> To keep
      your quiet conscience, you can ask Cracklock not to modify any file by
      selecting <b>"None"</b>.
    </p>
    <p>
      In this case,
      you will not allowed to run your program straight from the Explorer
      neither from a DOS window. You would have to run it from the Cracklock
      manager, wich is the simplest way, or from the modified shortcut in the
      Windows <b>start menu</b>, or even <a href=
      "apprunning.htm#explorer">using the contextual menu in
      Explorer</a>.
    </p>
	
    <h3>Parameter a program directly from the Explorer</h3>
    <p>
      You can use Windows Explorer to set up a program for use with Cracklock, without having to start
      the Cracklock Manager.
    <br>
		In Windows Explorer, go to the directory where the executable files of your program
		are located in.
    </p>
    <p align="center">
      <img src= "explorer.gif" width="449" height="262"><br>
      <b>Windows Explorer</b>
    </p>

    <p> In this window, click with the right button on the executable file of your
      program (VBDate.exe in our example). A contextual menu appears (depending
      upon the installed utilities, it can look slightly different) :
    </p>
    <p align=center> <img src="contextmenu.gif"><br><b>Contextual menu</b></p>

    <p> In this menu, select <b>"Properties"</b> ; a window with several tabs is shown. Select
      the <b>Cracklock</b> tab :

	  <b>The Cracklock property sheet</b>
    </p>

    <p>
      If you want
      to enable Cracklock for this program, mark the <b>"Activate
      Cracklock"</b> option.
    </p>
    <p>
      Select the
      <b>"Show advanced options"</b> option to access the <a href=
      "howtosetup.htm#config">same options as the manager ones</a>.
