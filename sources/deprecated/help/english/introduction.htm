    <h1>How does Cracklock work ?</h1>
    <p>Cracklock
      controls a list of programs you set up. When a program from this list
      needs time or date, Cracklock operates, bluffing the calling program and
      returning the pre-determined date or time you have set. So, the program
      "thinks" to be at the date/time it accepts for running.
    </p>
    
	<ul>
      <li><b>For the end user</b><br>
		Cracklock helps you to bypass the problems caused by the 30th day bug,
		a defect that is nowadays very frequent in software available on the Net. A program affected by
		this bug will fail to run when a certain period of time has passed after its installation.
		</li>
	
		<li><b>For the developer: a safe method for Y2K testing</b><br>
		With the help of Cracklock, developers can readily test or check the "Year
		2000 compatibility" (Y2K) of their software.
		<br>
		  Suppose that you want to check the program you are developing for Y2K compatibility.		  
		  To perform the test you decide to change the global system
	      date/time to 31th december 1999 and then launch your program in order to debug it.
		  The drawback of this method is that it affects all the programs currently running on the 
		  machine. One consequence is that the date stamp of the files created or modified by 
		  any software running on Windows will be set to 31th december 1999. 
	    <br>
		  Some other software may even stop working, as if they were "lost in time". That would be the case
		  for all these poorly developed softwares that are affected by the notorious "30th day bug".	  
		  If you run such software while you are testing your program against Y2K compliance,
		  then you will run into trouble: the bugged sofware will be confused about the date and will stop working.
		<br><br>Cracklock overcomes all these problems by allowing you to specify the date on an application basis.
