	<div class="log">
	<h2>3.8.27 - 1st December 2007</h2>
	<ul>
	<li>New feature: in the loader-based injection mode, the loader is now more furtive:
	the application cannot detect that it is being debugged.</li>
	<li>Fixed: When the import table of a PE file contained more than one occurrences of the module KERNEL32.DLL, the PE file could not be backed-up automatically by the manager.	
	</li>
	<li>Bug fix: In some circumstance, the Cracklock manager window positioned itself in the invisible part of the screen.</li>
	</ul>
	
	<div class="log">
	<h2>3.8.26 - 15 September 2007</h2>
	<ul>
	<li>Update: Chinese and French translation updated</li>
	<li>Fixed: The setup can again be run without requiring administrator privileges</li>
	<li>Fixed: applications crashed if no virtual mode (time, date or timezone) was selected.</li>
	<li>Fixed: PE executable files containing a Bound Import table caused a crash of the application.</li>
	<li>Fixed: Link checksum in PE files are now recalculated whenever the files are altered (this only occurs in static injection mode).</li>
	<li>Fixed: Allows the resident injector mode on Windows>=NT</li>	
	<li>Fixed: The setup now kills the resident injector before copying files</li>
	</ul>

	
	<h2>3.8.20 - 11 September 2007</h2>
	<ul>
	<li>The configuration dialog has been redesigned.</li>
	<li>New feature: you can create a shortcut on the desktop that will start the application with Cracklock loader. (There is a hotlink in the configuration dialog to create the shortcut).</li>
	<li>New feature: there is now a Setting window available from the Manager that allows you to configure general settings for Cracklock. It contains the following options:
		<ul>
		<li>Add/remove Cracklock to the PATH environment variable (so that an application can find CLKERN.DLL if it uses static injection)</li>
		<li>An option to copy CLKERN.dll to the folder of each application. Usefull if you use static injection and you don't want Cracklock to be in the PATH environment variable.		
		<li>Activate system-wide injection by launching a small application at logon that is responsible for injecting Cracklock's DLL in every process.</li>
		<li>Activate system-wide injection using AppInitDll (requires admin rights).</li>
		<li>Install/uninstall the shell-extension for Windows explorer (requires admin rights).</li>
		</ul>
	<li>Small bugs fixed in the manager and in the installation.</li>
	</ul>

	
	<h2>3.8.13 - 8 August 2007</h2>
	<ul>
	<li>New feature: a virtual timezone can be selected for each application running under Cracklock. For instance this feature allows you to solve the <a href="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&q=outlook%20timezone%20problem">"Microsoft Outlook timezone problem"</a>
	by selecting the appropriate timezone.</li>
	<li>The configuration dialog has been redesigned
	(Note that some messages have not been translated in other languages yet).</li>	
	<li>The manager's list contains new columns showing the date, time and timezone selected for each application.</li>
	<li>Fixed: the loader injection method (MCL.EXE) now works again. With this method, it is not necessary to alter any executable file to activate Cracklock.</li>
	<li>Fixed: the loader MCL.exe now parses correctly its command line parameters. It is now possible to load an application with optional command line parameters with the syntax "MCL.EXE APP.EXE APP_PARAMETERS"</li>
	<li>Fixed: the system-wide option (when the system time is changed for real instead of being virtualized) did not work properly.</li>
	<li>Several minor bugs have been fixed.</li>
	<li>Setup: new option to decide whether to install a system-wide injector resident in memory (CLINJECT.exe launched at the logon or CLKERN.DLL loaded as an AppInit DLL)</li>
	<li>Update: CLKERN.dll has been updated to take into account new win32 kernel functions that have been introduced in recent Windows updates</li>
	<li>Internal: PEDUMP replaced by DUMPBIN in the toolchain.</li>
	<li>A new example is now added automatically to the list of managed applications: it allows you to test Cracklock on the Windows control panel date/time applet.</li>
	</ul>

	<h2>3.8.9 - 2 August 2007</h2>
	<ul>
	<li>Portuguese language added. Thanks to Marcelo Schneider for the translation.</li>
	<li>Internal: the Makefiles that were used to compile the sources are now replaced by a Visual Studio project. MSBuild is now used instead of GNU make.</li>
	<li>Internal: the new "secure" versions of the string functions from the standard C library are now used. This protects Cracklock from potential buffer overflow attacks.</li>
	</ul>
	
	<h2>3.8.8 - 7 November 2005</h2>
	<ul>
	<li>Fixed: the setup now proposes to not install component that need administrator rights (like explorer shell extensions)</li>
	<li>Fixed: applications configurations are now stored at the user level instead of the machine level (this permits to use Cracklock on a public computer)</li>
	<li>Internal fix: the make build system is used in place of the Perl script files. Visual Studio Toolkit 2003 is used to compile the C++ sources.</li>
	</ul>
		
    <h2>3.8.7 - 16 September 2005</h2>
