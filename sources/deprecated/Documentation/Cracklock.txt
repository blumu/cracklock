OVERVIEW
========

Cracklock is a utility which corrects a frequent bug that appears in a lot of sharewares : I've recently noticed that many sharewares seem to stop working after a limited period of time, frequently a 30 days period. This bug is so frequent that I use to call it "the 30th day virus"

Thanks to Cracklock : no more problem !

With this utility, you can assign a date, a time and some options to every program that runs under Windows 95/98/ME/NT4/2000. After that, no matter the actual day or time : these programs are bluffed and they believe to be at the dummy date/time you have assigned. The bug is bypassed, and your sharewares keep working without any period limit.

CRACKLOCK IS FREEWARE : YOU'RE FREE TO DISTRIBUTE IT.

Cracklock has been developed with Visual C++ 5.0.
